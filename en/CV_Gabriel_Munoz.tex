\section{Interests}

I am particularly interested in those methodological approaches to increase the quality and predictability of software development processes, both classical methodologies (CMMI) and agile (Scrum, Kanban). Also in how to get both (classical and agile) work together.
I am interested in international projects and/or related to University research and technological innovation.

%\subsection{Review}

%Alice approaches Wonderland as an anthropologist, but maintains a strong sense of noblesse oblige that comes with her class status. She has confidence in her social position, education, and the Victorian virtue of good manners. Alice has a feeling of entitlement, particularly when comparing herself to Mabel, whom she declares has a ``poky little house," and no toys. Additionally, she flaunts her limited information base with anyone who will listen and becomes increasingly obsessed with the importance of good manners as she deals with the rude creatures of Wonderland. Alice maintains a superior attitude and behaves with solicitous indulgence toward those she believes are less privileged.
